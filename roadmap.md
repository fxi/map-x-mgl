## List of future developments:

### 2018

<b>Q3-Q4: MapX API</b>
- Consolidation of the server-side API

<b>Q3-Q4: Interface translation</b>
- MapX interface in 8-12 languages in addition to the current English, French, Dari and Pashto

<b>Q4: Customization of MapX settings by project</b>
- Possibility to customize, for each MapX project, the color of interface elements (such as text, borders, background, shadows) and the color of map elements (such as background, country shadow, text, text outline, water layer, roads layer, buildings layer, boundaries layer, disputed boundaries layer)

<b>Q4: Alignment of MapX with international data and metadata standards</b>
- Bridge between MapX and GeoServer for automatic publication of MapX datasets in GeoServer
- Support of SLD files in MapX
- Export of MapX styles to SLD
- Ability to export MapX metadata to ISO19115
- Ability to import ISO19115 metadata into MapX

<b>Q4: New functions</b>
- A tool for monitoring user interaction with the platform (e.g., number of hits, user requests, resource consumption client/server side, views visited and average time of visit, etc.) will be implemented in MapX

<b>Q4: Improvements of existing features</b>
- Multiple layers overlap: Temporary overlap tool for vector layers that can be used on the active views on map by any user.
- The quality of maps that can be produced from MapX will be improved. Maps will be available in formats such as PDF and will include relevant cartographic elements such as title, legends, North arrow, scale bar and basic metadata for each layer
- List of supported export formats will be extended to CSV
- Data integrity assessment framework (WWW) will be implemented in a visual way. This will to allow users to assess the integrity of each data layer hosted or streamed. This includes data reliability, technical accessibility, data openness and data sustainability. Implementation will be done in the form of a colour graded bar showing percentage score against integrity. The score should be clickable to reveal the full outcomes of the assessment framework
- The list of supported cartographic data will be extended from WGS84 to a set of projections systems. On the client side, however, the maps will be shown in Web Mercator projection only
- Multiple layer query will be extended to WMS views to allow users to visualize a subset of overlapping information based on several vector or WMS layers
- User experience will be improved. This includes simplifying the access to existing functionalities and reducing friction in the data upload process. This will prevent users from publishing data with incomplete metadata or with low integrity

### 2019

<b>Q1: Filtering functions</b>
- Filtering functions will be implemented for users to set their own search criteria for viewing and downloading data sets. This will be made through the use of SQL queries

<b>Q3: Dynamic dashboards</b>
- Expanded dashboard functionality will be developed, with the ability to dynamically select feature types from drop-down lists, and to include temporal datasets
